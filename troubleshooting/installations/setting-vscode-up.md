## you're done!

We did this so that:

1. You can choose python environments on VSCode and make sure your libraries are available.
2. From anywhere in your terminal (git-bash, iTerm2, Terminal, etc) you can navigate your system through `cd folder` commands and then write `code . `. This will save a lot of navigation time.
